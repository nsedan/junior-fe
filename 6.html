<!-- Given the following code and the assumption that "body" has 100% height what would you expect the layout to look like and give a brief explanation of why? -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: flex;
            flex: 1;
        }

        .blue {
            flex: 1;
            background-color: blue;
        }

        .red {
            flex: 1;
            background-color: red;
        }

        .yellow {
            flex: 2;
            background-color: yellow;
        }

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="blue"></div>

<p>
    The yellow element has flex-grow assigned to 2 and blue and red to 1, which means that yellow will be streched to
    occupy the same as red and blue combined.
