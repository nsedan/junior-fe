Given the following code what would you expect to see in the console?

const testArray = [
  {
    name: 'John',
    id: 1,
  },
  {
    name: 'Mary',
    id: 2,
  },
  {
    name: 'Terry',
    id: 3,
  },
].map((e) => e.id);

console.log(testArray);


Anwser: 
Map method takes an array, itereates through it passing a function on every element of that array and returns another array with the result.
In this case it will return an array composed with only the ids, like the following [1, 2, 3].
